# Tic Tac Toe in Rust

## Description:
This is the first project I made in the Rust language.
I don't know what to put here, for the most part the code is pretty self explanatory and I commented almost everything as well.
Go have fun!

## Running it:
* run.bat runs the 'cargo run' command, which won't work if you don't have rust installed
* the tictactoe.exe is directly compiled with rustc, I swear it's not a virus
